# cash-register

The Cash Register project is a web-based app that simulates a basic cash register system. It's designed to help users manage sales transactions by calculating totals, taxes, and change. This project is a great way to practice HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

I created this as a part of the freecodecamp Javascript course!
